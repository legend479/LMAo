# Software Architecture Concepts

## Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: Single instance pattern
- **Factory**: Object creation pattern
- **Observer**: Event notification pattern
- **Strategy**: Algorithm selection pattern

## Microservices Architecture
- Single responsibility per service
- Decentralized data management
- Fault tolerance and resilience
- Technology diversity

## API Design
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- GraphQL for flexible data queries
- Consistent error handling
- API versioning strategies

## Database Design
- Normalization principles
- NoSQL patterns (document, key-value, graph)
- ACID properties
- CAP theorem considerations

## Testing Strategies
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for interactions
- End-to-end user journey tests
- Performance and load testing

## Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies (browser, CDN, application)
- Load balancing and scaling
- Database query optimization
- Asynchronous processing
